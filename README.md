Film Rating Program
===================

This program has been written for a coursework
during my last semester of my two year 
technical degree in Computer Science while 
my Erasmus student exchange at the University 
of Portsmouth (England).

To run this program you should have Haskell
install on your computer :

sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
cd Film-Rating-Program-folder
ghc template.hs -o template.o
./template
